# Arveth Wordsearch - Arvsearth

How difficult could a word search be? Old English hard?

This program will generate a word search made up of the letters of a word without actually containing the word.

Inspired by [To make terrible wordsearches. | Charles Lohr's Blog](http://cnlohr.blogspot.com/2014/02/to-make-terrible-wordsearches.html)

## Roadmap

* ~~Output an image to make it harder to cheat~~
* Make commandline friendly to accept arguments for size and word
* Allow multiple words to be dis-allowed
* Accept a partially pre-populated word search and fill in around it
* Make it easier to create a word search that does contain, exactly once, some word(s)

## Running Locally

It's not friendly yet. Sorry :(

```commandline
pipenv --python 3
